# OCRmishmash

This is a program I wrote for a "do whatever you want" class assignment over ~3 days. 

It was a chance for me to work with Python (a language I am still learning) and third party libraries to achieve things that I would not otherwise be able to do as an individual programmer (e.g. I couldn't write an OCR algorithm myself!) and combine them in "useful" ways. This was also my first experience building a GUI in a Python program with the use of Tkinter.

Key technologies/libraries were OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with the help of Tesseract/PyTesseract, a spell-checking library with the help of Enchant/PyEnchant and integration with WolframAlpha to answer questions.

Functionality-wise it is a playful example of things that a user might want to do after reading in text using OCR technology including even breaking caesar ciphered text.

The folder "Functionality Screenshots" will give you an idea of what the running program looks like.



NOTE about wolfram alpha:
- As this is a public repository I have removed the wolfram alpha appID, so do not expect it to function.
- You are welcome to make your own AppID through wolfram alpha and adjust the code in wolfram.py
