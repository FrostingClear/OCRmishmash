# OCRmishmash

This is a program I wrote for a "do your own thing" class assignment over ~3 days. 

I took that chance to work with Python (a language I am still learning) and chose to work with third party libraries that I found interesting (e.g. OCR). This was also my first experience building a GUI in a Python program with the use of Tkinter.

Key technologies/libraries were OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with the help of Tesseract/PyTesseract, a spell-checking library with the help of Enchant/PyEnchant and integration with WolframAlpha to answer questions.

Functionality-wise it is a playful example of things that a user might want to do after reading in text using OCR technology including breaking caesar ciphered text.

You can make minor calibrations to the OCR algorithm and teach it new words as well to integrate into the dictionary.


The folder "Functionality Screenshots" will give you an idea of what the running program looks like.

How to run:
- You will need to install the necessary libraries like tesseract/pytesseract, enchant/pyenchant, wolframalpha
- Program should be started from main.py


NOTE about wolfram alpha:
- As this is a public repository I have removed the wolfram alpha appID, so do not expect it to function.
- You are welcome to make your own AppID through wolfram alpha and adjust the code in wolfram.py
